# Producer-Consumer-Problem

The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem in operating systems. 
The problem is defined as follows: there is a fixed-size buffer and a Producer process, and a Consumer process. 
The Producer process creates an item and adds it to the shared buffer.
